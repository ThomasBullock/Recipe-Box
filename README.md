# Free Code Camp Data Visualization Project

[Build a Recipe Box](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-recipe-box) w/ redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
Material Design Components added with [React-Toolbox](http://react-toolbox.com/#/) by using [react-toolbox-themr](https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox-themr) because Create React App doesn't play nice.

This tutorial by [Dan Abramov](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-persisting-the-state-to-the-local-storage) was very helpful in setting up localStorage.
